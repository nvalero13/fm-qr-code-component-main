## About

I have done this Frontend Mentor exercise to familiarize myself with the process of making challenges and submite them.
I didn't need to use grid or flexbox except to center the component on the screen.
The measures are a bit by eye because I have not used the premium function with the figma design and I had to rely on a png.
